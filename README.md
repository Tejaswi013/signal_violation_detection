# signal_violation_detection
This system automatically detects vehicles that cross a red light using AI and computer vision. It tracks vehicles in a video, checks if they cross a manually set stop line, and highlights them as violators for 1 second before returning to normal. This helps reduce accidents, enforce traffic rules**, and **eliminate manual monitoring.
